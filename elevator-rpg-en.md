# Elevator RPG

> You are stuck in a broken elevator, with some strangers. What do you do?

This game is about being stuck in an elevator, with strangers. You'll have to
answer some questions?

* Why did you get into this elevator?
* Will you try to escape it?
* Do you start a conversation with the other ones?
* What will you tell them?
* What will you discover about them?

## Preps

Each Player assumes the role of a Character. You are free to describe this
character as you wish : precisely or vaguely, with or without describing your
appearance, your psychology, your profession, your family situation... Nothing
is mandatory. It might be as interesting to describe as less as possible, which
would lead you to improvise during the game.

Your Character **may have no name!**

Take note of these details on one side of a piece of paper. On the other side,
you'll write down our "little secret".

### Mandatory Trait

You must think about a Secret. It can be anything: something you can't tell
anyone, a physical disability, a secret identity, a crime, a secret love, a plan
you can't tell to anyone, etc.

## Game start

### With a Game Master

The Gamemaster leads the Characters towards the elevator. This elevator can be
situated anywhere: "in a big city", "in San Francisco", "in *this* special
building". Wherever it is, the Characters will all end in this broken elevator,
stuck between two levels.

#### A few questions

* Is the light still on?
* Is the alarm system still working?
* How long will the Characters wait until the rescue team will save them?

Of course, these questions are just indications, there are many others that can
emerge during the game, as the situation evolves and new events occur.

#### Think about the end

The Game Master can think about "how the game ends". The rescue team can go and
reach the Characters at some point, if you want.

But you may stop the game as soon as one of the Character has revealed his/her
secret to the others, or if one of the Characters has discovered that secret.

#### The Dialog

The whole game is a Dialog. Everything is just a matter of discussion, between
Players, or between the Gamemaster and the Players. The Players are free to ask
anything, and answer to questions the way they want to. It's the GM's job to
manage this Dialog, by arguing with the Players, insist on some aspect of their
answers, provocate them, and maybe try to initiate discors between Players. This
game is inside an enclosed place, it's a stressing situation, and the GM should
maintain this pressure as best as he could, even if one of them is flipping out.

### GM-Less variant

The Players can agree on a duration (e.g. we'll play for 1 or 2 hours), and will
have to chat with each other, playing their roles. When the time is over, the
rescue team is reaching the Characters and the game is over. Then each Character
is writing down his/her guess of what is the Secret of the other Players. Once
it's done, the Players check who's got the best answers.
