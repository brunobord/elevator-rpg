# Elevator RPG

> You are stuck in a broken elevator, with some strangers. What do you do?

This game is about being stuck in an elevator, with strangers. You'll have to
answer some questions?

* Why did you get into this elevator?
* Will you try to escape it?
* Do you start a conversation with the other ones?
* What will you tell them?
* What will you discover about them?

## Preps

Each Player assumes the role of a Character. You are free to describe this
character as you wish : precisely or vaguely, with or without describing your
appearance, your psychology, your profession, your family situation... Nothing
is mandatory. It might be as interesting to describe as less as possible, which
would lead you to improvise during the game.

Your Character **may have no name!**

Take note of these details on one side of a piece of paper. On the other side,
you'll write down our "little secret".

### Mandatory Trait

You must think about a Secret. It can be anything: something you can't tell
anyone, a physical disability, a secret identity, a crime, a secret love, a plan
you can't tell to anyone, etc.
